        or the past 15 years, I've worked as a <span class="kiemel">Product Designer</span> designing and building a wide range of digital products. I believe that good design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and strive to create intuitive and engaging user experiences.

        During my career, I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of clients in fields such as Editorial, Healthcare, Banking, Sports, Public Administration, E-commerce, and Information Technology.
        Some of my notable clients include Scuderia Ferrari F1, Enel Energia, ING Direct, and HCL Software. Most recently, I served as a Senior Product Designer at the Italian Department for Digital Transformation, where I managed complex ecosystems of user interfaces and front-end libraries for key government initiatives.

    <p>In addition to my work as a designer, I co-founded Robodomain, a SaaS company focused on domain management tools. Our software was acquired by DNSimple in 2013, which was a valuable learning experience.</p>
    <p>From time to time, I <span class="kiemel">write</span> and <span class="kiemel">speak</span> about design methodologies, workflow, and tools at conferences and events. I am also a lecturer at UXUniversity, where I conduct a full-day workshop on Design Systems and Atomic Design.</p>
